# NLP Pipeline for Misinformation Detection & Behavioral Risk Analysis on Reddit (r/climate)

**Graduate Research Project | The SOURCE, Syracuse University**  
*September 2022 ‚Äì June 2023*

---

## Project Overview

This project developed an end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) pipeline to analyze over **1 million Reddit posts** from the r/climate subreddit. The goal was to detect misinformation patterns, classify user intent, analyze sentiment trends, and identify behavioral risk signals associated with belief dynamics and misinformation spread.

The pipeline includes data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, behavioral risk detection, and deployment of a Flask web app on Google Cloud Platform for real-time monitoring.

---

## Objectives

- Understand and classify topical themes and user intent within climate discussions
- Detect misinformation and behavioral risk markers such as hostility, conspiratorial language, and distress
- Improve sentiment analysis accuracy on social media text
- Deploy an automated, scalable pipeline for near real-time data processing and visualization

üîÅ End-to-End Project Flow: Reddit NLP Pipeline (r/climate)
üì• Data Collection

Scraped 1M+ posts from r/climate using Pushshift API

Captured post content, metadata, and engagement signals (e.g., score, comments)

üßπ Preprocessing

Cleaned and tokenized text (retained case + demojized emojis)

Removed noise: URLs, special characters, common stopwords

Preserved features like capitalization, emoji sentiment, and post timing

üìä Feature Engineering

Extracted TF-IDF vectors and Word2Vec embeddings

Added metadata-based features (e.g., post length, flair, caps ratio)

Created custom emotion/sentiment scores using VADER and NRC lexicon

üß† Topic Modeling + User Intent Segmentation

Used BERTopic and weak supervision (keywords, flairs)

Tuned K-Means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchical clustering

Achieved 85% accuracy in labeling posts into segments like activism, denial, policy

üìà Sentiment Analysis (Enhanced)

Combined VADER with custom LSTM + GloVe model

Improved classification accuracy by 15% on 100K manually tagged posts

‚ö†Ô∏è Behavioral Risk Signal Detection

Labeled posts with weak supervision into risk categories (e.g., hostility, hopelessness)

Trained classifiers (Random Forest, Logistic Regression) on these tags

üöÄ Deployment

Built and deployed a Flask app on Google Cloud Platform

Automated ingestion + prediction pipelines to handle 400K+ posts/day

- Achieved **85% accuracy** in user intent segmentation  
- Detected early warning signals for misinformation and belief polarization  
- Provided scalable, real-time monitoring capability for research teams
